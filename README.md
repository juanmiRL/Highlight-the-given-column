# Highlight-the-given-column
Using the same dataset used in last class category-brands.csv create a GitHub repository with a working GitHub Page url addressing the following problem: 
- When you click on the row in the table below the bas in the graph is highlighted in a different color.
- Try to show the data in decreasing order, only plotting the first n elements (you can fix n=10 or make it variable). Use Array.sort function together with d3.descending function.
